Full-Stack Assessment: React & Node.js

This repository contains my solution to a full-stack assessment, split into two sections: React (front-end) and Node.js (back-end). Below is an overview of the folder structure and the approach I followed to solve each question.

The React-related solutions are placed in the frontCode folder.

The Node.js-related solutions are stored in the server folder. All solutions to questions related to Node.js can be found inside the src/assessment_answers/ directory. Each question is represented by a JavaScript file where the question is written as a comment, followed by my solution code.

Files in the server/src/assessment_answers/ folder:
1.js, 2.js, 3.js, 4.js, 5.js: These files contain solutions to questions 1 through 5.
